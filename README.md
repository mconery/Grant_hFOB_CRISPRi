# Grant hFOB CRISPRi Screen and Associated Analyses
This Github is a repository for all the code used to complete the analyses
presented in "GWAS-informed data integration and non-coding CRISPRi screen 
reveals etiological insights for bone mineral density" (Conery et al.). It
is organized into the following eight sections:

### 1) 1_ATAC-seq_Processing
### 2) 2_S-LDSC_Heritability_Enrichment
### 3) 3_hFOB_Capture-C_and_RNA-seq
### 4) 4_Target_Selection_and_sgRNA_Design
### 5) 5_Single-Cell_QC_and_Sceptre
### 6) 6_Osteoblast_Assays
### 7) 7_Genetic_Correlations
### 8) 8_Multi-Trait_Fine-Mapping
