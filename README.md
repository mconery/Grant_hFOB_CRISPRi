# Grant hFOB CRISPRi Screen and Associated Analyses
This Github is a repository for all the code used to complete the analyses
presented in "GWAS-informed data integration and non-coding CRISPRi screen 
reveals etiological insights for bone mineral density" (Conery ###et al.###). 
It is organized into the following eight sections:

### 1) 1_ATAC-seq_Processing ###
This folder contains the ENCODE configuration files necessary to call 
peaks for the new and re-processed ATAC/ChiP-seq data sets used in the S-LDSC 
analysis and CRISPRi target selection. It also contains the scripts used 
to download the reprocessed FASTQ files and the files necessary to check the 
quality of the osteoclast datasets.

### 2) 2_S-LDSC_Heritability_Enrichment ###
This folder contains the scripts used for executing the S-LDSC analysis which
includes the script used to munge the summary statistics used in the S-LDSC
and cross-trait LDSC analyses. The following figures were generated by the 
code in this section:
\begin{itemize}
\Fig. 1 - **make_s-ldsc_enrichment_plots.R**  
\fig. S1 - **make_s-ldsc_enrichment_plots.R** 
\end{itemize}

### 3) 3_hFOB_Capture-C_and_RNA-seq ###
### 4) 4_Target_Selection_and_sgRNA_Design ###
### 5) 5_Single-Cell_QC_and_Sceptre ###
### 6) 6_Osteoblast_Assays ###
### 7) 7_Genetic_Correlations ###
### 8) 8_Multi-Trait_Fine-Mapping ###
